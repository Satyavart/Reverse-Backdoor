Reverse Backdoor
----------------------------------
  Consider there are two computers. One is yours(Hacker) and other one is any user(victim of backdoor).Then,
  
      1.Now run listener.py in your computer.
      2.Run the backdoor.py in victim's PC.
      3.Now you will get the hardware info of the victim's PC and can access any file and folder of the computer.
      4.Or delete any file.
      5.Or send any file from hacker to victim.
      6.Or get any file from victim to hacker.
      7.Start automatically on every boot.(Currently only for windows user)
      8.In case of any error instead of display it on the screen it will just quit itself.
  
  With this you can send malware or file like to extraxt chrome password, firefox password, keylogger, etc. 
  ***Remember current .exe is configured to my ip so you have to change it manually while creating an exe.
